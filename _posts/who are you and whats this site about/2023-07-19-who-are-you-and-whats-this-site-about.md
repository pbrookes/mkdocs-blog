My name's Paul Brookes and I'm a technical writer based in Germany, where I oversee my employer's fledgling tech writing department.

When I joined, a large part of my brief was to evaluate systems and software to document our products. I decided on [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)-[Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), as it was—on balance—the best tool for the job. Of course your needs may be different and you might need a different tool: it's important you properly evaluate software before you deploy it. (I created this site with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) because it has lots of blog templates.)

But if your requirements are similar to mine, it's a good choice. With the caveat that you _do_ need to be technically minded and prepared to go into the configuration if things go wrong. In the real world, not all tech writers have developers and web designers on call when they run into problems.

The purpose of this blog to document my journey and hopefully save you some time. There's a lot of help out there, but it's often developer-focused and the majority of us aren't developers.
